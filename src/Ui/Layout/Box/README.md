# Kirby Box

The `kirby-box` component is a multi-purpose box that is most often used for empty states or short info.

If you place a button in the box, it's perfect to provide a default action for empty states, like adding a new page or any other kind of item.

## Example

```html
<kirby-box>Box content</kirby-box>
```

## Props

### state
Set the state to `empty` in order to give the box the typical empty state design

```html
<kirby-box state="empty">Nothing to see here</kirby-box>
```
